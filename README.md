## Description

This Website describes the services provided by Horiseon.


## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](/repos/challenge1-code-refactor/assets/images/code-refactor-screenshot.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## What I did:

1. I modified many of the DIV tags to make them semantic elements
2. I modified the css code to consolidate sections
3. Added comments in the code
